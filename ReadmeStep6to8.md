This Terraform configuration will:

1. Create an IAM role named `rger-ecs-xray-taskrole` with the `AWSXRayDaemonWriteAccess` policy attached
2. Create an IAM role named `rger-ecs-xray-taskexecutionrole` with three policies attached:
   - `AmazonSSMReadOnlyAccess` (for accessing Parameter Store)
   - `SecretsManagerReadWrite` (for accessing Secrets Manager)
   - `AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy` (standard ECS execution policy)
3. Create an ECS Fargate cluster named `rger-flask-xray-cluster` with container insights enabled



To use this configuration:

1. Save it to a file (e.g., `ecs-setup.tf`)
2. Run `terraform init` to initialize the provider
3. Run `terraform plan` to see what will be created
4. Run `terraform apply -target=module.ecs` to create the resources
4. Run `terraform apply -target=module.vpc` to create the resources

The outputs will show you the ARNs of the created roles and the cluster name, which you can use when defining your ECS task definitions later.

The `ecs-setup.tf` configuration provided **does not require an explicit VPC** because:

1. **ECS Cluster Creation**: An ECS cluster itself is just a logical grouping of resources (tasks/services) and doesn't require a VPC. The VPC comes into play when you create:
   - ECS Services
   - Task Definitions that require networking
   - Fargate tasks (which need subnets)

2. **IAM Roles**: These are global AWS resources not tied to any VPC.

However, when you later define:
- **ECS Services**
- **Task Definitions** (especially for Fargate)
- **Load Balancers** (if using them)

You **will need a VPC** with appropriate subnets (typically at least 2 across different AZs for high availability).

### Recommended Next Steps:
When you're ready to deploy actual services, you should either:
1. **Use your default VPC** (not recommended for production)
2. **Create a new VPC** (recommended):

```hcl
# Add this to your configuration when ready
resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
  
  tags = {
    Name = "rger-flask-vpc"
  }
}

resource "aws_subnet" "public" {
  count             = 2
  vpc_id            = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block        = "10.0.${count.index}.0/24"
  availability_zone = "us-east-1${count.index == 0 ? "a" : "b"}"
  
  tags = {
    Name = "rger-flask-public-${count.index}"
  }
}
```

### Key Points:
- The current setup works for just the cluster and IAM roles
- VPC becomes mandatory when you define tasks/services that need networking
- Fargate tasks require subnets (which require a VPC)

Would you like me to extend the configuration to include VPC setup and networking components for a complete ECS+Fargate ready environment?
